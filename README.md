# typertracker
This project was built in Python using PyCharm IDE. 

I wanted an uncluttered, data-heavy result telling me where all Honda Civic Type Rs are available for sale and then the average of those prices to give me a market value. I wanted to be able to "push a button" for this result, hence the Python software solution over a Google search.

I am currently working to get this to populate to HTML easily for user-interactivity. In the meantime, please find a snapshot below of the console output.
