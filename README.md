# typertracker
This is a program I built in Python that helps me easily monitor the market for a Honda Civic Type R vehicle. The program pulls current listings for Honda Civic Type R vehicles for sale in the US and quickly returns only listing, price and location data. It then returns an average listing price.

Through research and tutorials, I adapted a webscraper construct to build this program. I used PyCharme CE IDE which provides a virtual environment ("venv") of dependency libraries that I have not uploaded to github but are documented in the code.

For those interested, this is a passion project as are most projects that I develop. The Honda Civic Type R is one of the greatest cars ever engineered and re-engineered.
